## Analysis

### Dashboard 1

This dashboard compares the trip durations of Citi Bikes in NYC based on different variables. First off, there is a sheet that states the total average trip duration in seconds in order to set a standard value of comparison. Secondly, I made a bar chart that shows the total number of bike trips over a certain period of time using the number of records in the CSV. I then made two bar charts that include filters to specify the variables being contrasted in regards to trip duration totals. In the trip duration by gender chart, results showed that the male gender had a total trip duration that was almost three times as much as the female gender. Whereas, in the bike usage per user type chart, the data showed that Citi Bike subcribers had a trip duration total that was almost eight times higher than regular customers. Lastly, I made a line graph to compare the trip duration total based on the users' birth year. The data showed that users born after the year 2000 were way more likely to have a trip duration total that was over 2,000 seconds. 

### Dashboard 2

This dashboard compares different Citi Bikes stations. First off, I made a bar chart that has all the individual bike IDs with their total trip durations in order to demonstrate which bikes are most likely to be due for maintenance soon. Secondly, I made two bar charts that have the number of records in descending orders, according to starting and ending station, in order to show which stations are more popular among users. The results showed that the specific stations that were used the most as starting stations were also used the most as ending stations. Lastly, I made a map to show the locations of the stations, using the stations' longtitudes and latitudes. In this map, each station has a marker whose size and color is based off of the number of records that station has. I did this to see if there was a specific area that has more records. Turns out, the stations near the Morris Canal are more likely to have a higher concentration of records than those in other areas.
